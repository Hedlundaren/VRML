#
#  This world illustrates how far you can go using the primitive
#  geometry nodes:  Box, Cone, and Cylinder.  An entire fairy-tale
#  castle is built by translating and rotating these shapes into
#  position.
#
#  Things to experiment with...
#	Change the color scheme to make the castle an evil lair.
#
#	Add texture maps to make the castle walls look like they are built
#	from stone.
#
#	Make the castle door an anchor.  Clicking on the door leads to
#	another world describing the castle interior.
#
#	Add panorama cloud and mountain textures to the Background node.
#
#	In Nintendo 64 style, add platforms that rise and fall and cannons
#	that rise up when you approach.  You can build these using
#	PositionInterpolators and TimeSensors to run the animations,
#	and ProximitySensors to trigger the actions.
