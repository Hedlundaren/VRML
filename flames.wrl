#VRML V2.0 utf8

#  This world illustrates the use of a script to cycle between
#  textures, and then encapsulation of the script, a clock, and
#  a polygon, all within a PROTO to create a new 'Flames' node
#  that makes flickering flames.
#
#  Three flame textures are used:
#	flames1.png
#	flames2.png
#	flames3.png
#
#  All three textures have a transparency channel (alpha channel) so
#  that areas outside of the flame are transparent.
#
#  flame1.png was hand-drawn in PhotoShop.  The other two flames were
#  created by applying the PhotoShop 'Twirl' filter to several parts of
#  the original flame.  This creates a curling effect that looks
#  vaugely flame-like.  For a better effect, use more flame images and
#  more care in applying the Twirl filter... or hand draw them all.
